# Predicting individuals who are most likely to open a Bank Account
This repository contains a colab notebook containing a project on Exploratory Data Analysis of Univariate, Bivariate  and Multivariate Analysis of Financial Dataset

## Description of the project

Financial inclusion is an essential contributor to long term economic growth. One strong indicator of financial inclusion is access to a bank account. 
This means that the more individuals who have access to a bank account in a country, the more promising it is to the economic growth of this country. 
For this reason, the project at hand required me to figure out how we can predict which individuals are more likely to open a bank account based 
on the demographic features available. Exploratory Data Analysis has been performed to study the demographic features of individuals and to better understand the features of the individuals with bank accounts and the Principal Component Analysis used to identify the features that contribute most to an individual having a bank account.
