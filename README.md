# Moringa_Data_Science_Core_W2_Independent_Project_2020_06_Terry_Migwi_Colab_Notebook
This repository contains a colab notebook containing a project on Exploratory Data Analysis of Uni-variate, Bi-variate  and Multi-variate Analysis of Financial Dataset

## Description of the project

Financial inclusion is an essential contributor to long term economic growth. One strong indicator of financial inclusion is access to a bank account. 
This means that the more individuals who have access to a bank account in a country, the more promising it is to the economic growth of this country. 
For this reason, the project at hand required me to figure out how we can predict which individuals are more likely to open a bank account based 
on the demographic features available
